            <h1>Estrus period and its effect on female mouse</h1>
            <p>
                Like other non-primate mammals like horses, pigs and cows, mouses also has estrus cycle.
                <br>An estrus cycle is a recurring period of sexual receptivity and fertility. In easy words, female mouses want to make children in this period.
                <br>While more activity and higher temperature are expected in this period, it does not mean that estrus period is a good indicator to predict mouses' activity level and temperatures.

            <p>
                In the figure, the Temperature is almost the same in both periods, but the activity level is much higher in the estrus period.
                <br>Still, the activity level is not a good indicator to predict the estrus period.
                <br>Let's see the reason in the next graph:
